# DnDToolKit


This toolkit was designed to help players with simple but somewhat repititve tasks during D&D sessions. Some planned features include an Encounter Generator that will allow you to premake scenarios and save them to use any time and an Inventory Management system. A working version of an Inititiatve Tracker is currently running but it along with the other features will be continued to be implemented and updated as time goes on.
